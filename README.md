# SVM Kernel Comparison – Streamlit App

This project compares Support Vector Machines (SVM) with **Linear Kernel** vs **RBF Kernel** on a circular dataset.  
The trained model is deployed on **Streamlit** for interactive use.

## 📈 Results
- **Linear Kernel**: Struggles with circular data, lower accuracy.  
- **RBF Kernel**: Performs better with ~0.749 accuracy.  
- Decision boundary plots show how RBF handles non-linear separation more effectively.

## 📝 Conclusion
The project demonstrates that **kernel choice matters** in SVM:
- Linear kernel is only good for linearly separable data.  
- RBF kernel is better suited for complex, circular, or non-linear patterns.
